Project: Library Management App (React)

In this experiment, I created a Library Management system using React.

Features:
1. Search books by title or author.
2. Add new books by entering title and author.
3. Remove books from the list.
4. Dynamic rendering of books using map().

Learnings:
- How to use useState for managing dynamic data.
- Passing props to child components (BookList).
- Using map() to render lists in React.
- Implementing search and filter functionality.
- Styling components with CSS.

This project helped me understand the core concepts of React such as
state, props, dynamic rendering, and event handling.
