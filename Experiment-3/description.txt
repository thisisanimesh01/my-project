Create a web-based admin dashboard page that includes the following sections:

Header: Contains the dashboard title and a theme switch (light/dark).

Sidebar: Includes navigation links such as Home, Users, and Settings.

Main Content Area: Placeholder for data visualization, reports, or welcome messages.

Footer: Displays footer text or copyright.

The page should:

Use CSS Grid to arrange and align these sections into a clean, professional layout.

Implement theme switching functionality so that the entire dashboard can switch between light mode and dark mode.

The switch should update background colors, text colors, and other style elements clearly, without requiring page reload.
