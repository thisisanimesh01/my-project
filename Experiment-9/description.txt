Title: Person Class Hierarchy with Student and Teacher Subclasses

Objective:
The goal of this experiment was to understand and apply the concept of inheritance in JavaScript (ES6 classes) inside a React project. We created a base class (Person) and extended it into specialized subclasses (Student and Teacher). This demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts such as inheritance, method overriding, and reusability in a modern JavaScript context.

Description of Work:

A Person class was created with properties name and age, and a method getInfo() to display basic information.

A Student class was created by extending Person. It added a new property grade and overrode the getInfo() method to include grade details.

A Teacher class was also created by extending Person. It added a new property subject and overrode the getInfo() method to include subject details.

These classes were written inside Person.jsx in the components folder.

In App.jsx, multiple instances of Student and Teacher were created and their getInfo() methods were called to display complete details.

Styling for the output was provided in App.css to show the information in a neat card layout.

Finally, the app was rendered using main.jsx.

Learning Outcomes:

Learned how to define and use ES6 classes in JavaScript.

Understood the concept of inheritance and how subclasses extend base classes.

Practiced method overriding using super to call parent methods and extend functionality.

Learned how to organize code into multiple files (App.jsx, Person.jsx, App.css, main.jsx) in a React project.

Understood the importance of modular design and reusability in software development.
