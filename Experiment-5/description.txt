In this project, I created a web-based product filtering system where users can easily view products by selecting a category from a dropdown menu. The product list updates dynamically using JavaScript DOM manipulation without reloading the page.

How it works:

All products (Shoes, Shirts, Gadgets) are stored inside a JavaScript array of objects.

On page load, all products are displayed in a neat card/grid layout.

When a user selects a category (e.g., Shoes), only the matching products are displayed.

Selecting “All” brings back the full product list.

UI Enhancements:

Products are shown in individual card-style boxes with borders and hover effects.

The layout is responsive, arranged in a grid for better readability.

The dropdown has a clean design with focus and hover highlights.

Learning Outcome:
Through this project, I practiced:

JavaScript arrays & filtering

DOM manipulation (innerHTML, createElement, appendChild)

Event handling (change event on dropdown)

CSS styling for grid layouts, card design, and hover animations

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of how JavaScript interacts with HTML & CSS to create a smooth, real-time user experience.
