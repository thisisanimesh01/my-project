In this project, I created a reusable ProductCard component in React. The component displays product details such as name, price, and stock status, and these details are passed using props.

At first, I learned how to create a simple component and render it by passing data individually through props. Later, I improved the code by creating an array of products and using the JavaScript map() function to loop through the array and dynamically render multiple ProductCard components.

This approach made the code cleaner, reusable, and more scalable. Instead of writing multiple <ProductCard /> tags manually, I just updated the product array, and the UI automatically displayed all the products.

Key Learnings

Props in React – I understood how props allow us to pass dynamic data into components.

Reusable Components – Once a component is made, it can be reused multiple times with different data.

JSX vs JS – I learned how JSX lets us write HTML-like code inside JavaScript for React components.

map() in React – Instead of hardcoding, I can loop through an array and render a list of components dynamically.

Clean & Scalable Code – With arrays + map, the app is easier to maintain, especially when dealing with many products.
